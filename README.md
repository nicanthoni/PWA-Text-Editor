# PWA - Text Editor

## Motivation
- This project exists to feature some of the most important expressions of the concept of Progressive Web Applications (PWA). This is a single page application that meets the criteria for a PWA, while featuring a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.
